## Article: Git and GitHub in Web Development

Git is a version control system used by developers to track changes in their code.
It helps developers work together on the same project without overwriting each
other’s work.

GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows developers to
store code online, collaborate with others, and manage projects efficiently.
GitHub is widely used in web application development for teamwork and deployment.

Using Git and GitHub improves code safety, collaboration, and project organization.
